        <p>When do you do it? When do you stop to think? To be alone with your thoughts.
Even when you’re put on a situation where you have “nothing to do”, odds are you grab your phone and start mindlessly scrolling in whatever your prefered app is.<br />
What if you did nothing? Just stood there and payed attention to your thoughts? Couldn’t you learn something? You have more knowledge than what you think. Just intaking it won’t do you any good if you don’t stop to reflect on it. It also helps you be more of a critical thinker. You can’t reflect on a fact and try to validate it if you don’t give yourself time to do it.</p>

        <p>Every Yes you give it’s an unmeasurable number of No’s that you’re saying.</p>
