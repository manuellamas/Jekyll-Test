I"<p>When do you do it? When do you stop to think? To be alone with your thoughts.
Even when youâ€™re put on a situation where you have â€œnothing to doâ€, odds are you grab your phone and start mindlessly scrolling in whatever your prefered app is.<br />
What if you did nothing? Just stood there and payed attention to your thoughts? Couldnâ€™t you learn something? You have more knowledge than what you think. Just intaking it wonâ€™t do you any good if you donâ€™t stop to reflect on it. It also helps you be more of a critical thinker. You canâ€™t reflect on a fact and try to validate it if you donâ€™t give yourself time to do it.</p>
